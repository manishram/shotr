### Using the API
Shorten URL
To shorten a URL using the API, send a POST request to the ```/v1/api/shorten-url``` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the destination parameter.

### Example Request:

POST /api/shorten-url

```json
{
    "destination": "https://example.com"
}
```

Example Response:

```json
{
    "destination": "https://example.com",
    "slug": "abcde",
    "updated_at": "2021-09-10T23:52:11.000000Z",
    "created_at": "2021-09-10T23:52:11.000000Z",
    "id": 1,
    "shortened_url": "http://localhost:8000/abcde"
}
```

### Error Responses
If the request is invalid or a non-valid URL is provided, the API will return a validation error response.
Example Validation Error Response:

```json
{
    "message": "The given data was invalid.",
    "errors": {
        "destination": [
            "The destination field is required.",
            "The destination must be a valid URL."
        ]
    }
}
